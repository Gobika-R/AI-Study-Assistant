# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com and sign in to your account**

2. **Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"**

3. **Fill out the repository details:**
   - **Repository name:** `ai-study-assistant` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description:** `AI-powered Study Assistant with text summarization, topic explanations, quizzes, and learning memory tracking`
   - **Visibility:** Public (recommended for portfolio projects)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. Use these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Projects\LLM"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**OR** simply run the provided script:
```powershell
.\setup-github.bat
```

## Step 3: Update Repository Information

1. **Update README.md** with your actual repository URL:
   - Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username
   - Replace `ai-study-assistant` with your actual repository name

2. **Add repository topics on GitHub:**
   - Go to your repository page
   - Click the gear icon next to "About"
   - Add topics: `ai`, `study-assistant`, `flask`, `nltk`, `education`, `python`, `web-app`

3. **Consider adding a LICENSE file:**
   - MIT License is common for open-source projects
   - Add it through GitHub's web interface: "Add file" â†’ "Create new file" â†’ name it `LICENSE`

## Step 4: Repository Features to Enable

1. **GitHub Pages** (if you want to host documentation):
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch â†’ main â†’ / (root)

2. **Issues and Discussions** (for collaboration):
   - Go to Settings â†’ General
   - Enable "Issues" and "Discussions"

3. **Branch Protection** (for team projects):
   - Go to Settings â†’ Branches
   - Add rule for main branch

## Sample Repository Description

When setting up your repository, use this description:

```
AI-powered Study Assistant web application built with Flask and NLTK. Features include intelligent text summarization, adaptive topic explanations, interactive quiz generation, and comprehensive learning progress tracking. Modern glass morphism UI with responsive design.
```

## Repository Topics/Tags

Add these topics to make your repository discoverable:
- `ai`
- `study-assistant`
- `flask`
- `nltk`
- `education`
- `python`
- `web-application`
- `machine-learning`
- `natural-language-processing`
- `student-tools`

## After Setup

Once your repository is live:

1. **Share the link** in your portfolio/resume
2. **Add a demo GIF or screenshots** to the README
3. **Star your own repository** (it's common practice!)
4. **Consider creating releases** for major versions
5. **Add a "Deploy to Heroku" button** for easy deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication errors:**
   - Use GitHub Personal Access Token instead of password
   - Enable 2FA and generate token in Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens

2. **Push rejected:**
   ```powershell
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Remote already exists:**
   ```powershell
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
   ```
