## üìù Code Quality Examples

### Clean Architecture
```python
class StudyAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory_file = 'student_memory.json'
        self.load_memory()
    
    def summarize_text(self, text: str) -> Dict:
        # Clear separation of concerns
        # Comprehensive error handling
        # Type hints for maintainability
```

### Modern Frontend
```javascript
// Event-driven architecture
async function summarizeText() {
    showLoadingWithProgress('Creating summary...');
    const result = await apiCall('/summarize', data);
    displayResults(result);
    trackAnalytics('summarization', performance);
}
```
