### Example 1: Science Text
```
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis requires sunlight, chlorophyll, carbon dioxide, and water. Oxygen is released as a byproduct. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.

### Example 2: History Text
```
The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776. It was primarily written by Thomas Jefferson and announced that the thirteen American colonies were no longer subject to British rule. The document established the United States as an independent nation and outlined the fundamental principles of democracy, including the idea that all people are created equal and have certain unalienable rights. The Declaration served as an inspiration for democratic movements around the world and remains one of the most important documents in American history.
