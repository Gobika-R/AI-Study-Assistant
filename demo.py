    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that focuses on creating computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be divided into two main categories: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks, such as playing chess, recognizing speech, or recommending products. This type of AI is what we see in most current applications, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation algorithms on social media platforms.

    General AI, also called strong AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI), refers to machines that would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capability. While general AI remains largely theoretical and is still a subject of ongoing research, it represents the ultimate goal for many AI researchers. The development of AI has been influenced by various fields, including computer science, mathematics, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.

    Machine learning, a subset of AI, has been particularly instrumental in recent advances. It involves training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. Deep learning, which uses neural networks with multiple layers, has enabled breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. However, AI also presents challenges and ethical considerations, including concerns about job displacement, privacy, bias in algorithms, and the need for responsible development and deployment of AI systems.

    ‚Ä¢ Use the readability score to understand text difficulty

    üí° EXPLANATIONS:
    ‚Ä¢ Try topics like: photosynthesis, gravity, democracy, evolution, climate change
    ‚Ä¢ Experiment with different difficulty levels for the same topic
    ‚Ä¢ Click on related topic badges to explore connected concepts
    ‚Ä¢ Check estimated reading time to plan your study session

    üß† QUIZZES:
    ‚Ä¢ Start with built-in topics for the best question quality
    ‚Ä¢ Notice difficulty indicators on each question (easy/medium/hard)
    ‚Ä¢ Review the difficulty breakdown after completing a quiz
    ‚Ä¢ Use "Get Study Tips" for personalized recommendations

    üìä MEMORY & PROGRESS:
    ‚Ä¢ Check your learning statistics in the Memory tab
    ‚Ä¢ View recent activity and topics studied
    ‚Ä¢ Get personalized recommendations based on your performance
    ‚Ä¢ Track quiz performance across different subjects

    üé® UI FEATURES:
